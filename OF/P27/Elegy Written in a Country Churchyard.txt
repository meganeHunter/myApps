  Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard

  Line1-12:

    The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
    The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea
    The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
    And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
    Now fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,
    And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
    Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
    And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;
    Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r
    The moping owl does to the moon complain
    Of such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,
    Molest her ancient solitary reign.
